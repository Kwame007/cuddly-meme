      "description": "TToo often home buyers in Accra face the need to compromise when buying a property, forced by market dynamics and unreliable suppliers to sacrifice either location or quality in order to purchase a property they can afford.Our homes present buyers with the opportunity to own a stylish, high-quality home in a central location, at competitive prices. Market leading payment plans (starting from only 10% down payment) make the investment even more affordable.This offer also translates to a high yield investment opportunity for buy-to-let investors.We train our teams to care about the details, whether this is in relation to client communications, managing construction costs, or interior fittings and finishing.This combination has lead to a track record of sell-out developments, market leading asset growth and rental yields, and an impressive record of repeat buyers and referrals.",
